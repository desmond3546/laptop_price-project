This project involves building a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on various features like 
brand, type, screen size, screen resolution, processor, RAM, storage, graphics card, operating system, and weight.
The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical data, scale numerical features, and address missing or inconsistent values.
Multiple regression models are evaluated and fine-tuned using techniques like grid search to identify the best-performing model.
The goal is to provide accurate price predictions, which can assist customers in comparing laptops or businesses in pricing their products competitively.
